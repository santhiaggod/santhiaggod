- 👋 Hi, I’m @santhiaggod
- 👀 You have clearly never seen me around here, as I'm just starting to manage my projects on GitHub, I'm interested in data science, 
    embedded software and medical software development...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create projects on Java, and web development. I'm also starting to prepare for a Medical Physics MSc but that's a whole different subject...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects where I can apply what I've learned about medical software or any sort of software that makes life easier for 
   people, really...
- 📫 How to reach me: hit me up at santiago.gutierrez@udea.edu.co if you're interested in a junior dev, eager to work with diverse, and creative teams...
